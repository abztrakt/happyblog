""" happyblog - yet another django blog app
"""

This is a super simple little blog app I put together for some practice with django. It's intentionally very bare bones.

This app requires south. Install south from http://south.aeracode.org/. Download happyblog to somewhere in your PYTHONPATH and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS. Run a syncdb and migrate, and you should be good to go.

Check the DEPENDENCIES.txt for other dependencies.
